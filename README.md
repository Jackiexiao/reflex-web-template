# reflex-web-tempalte

https://demo-web.reflex.run 

I found that the [official website](https://reflex.dev/) of reflex is the best reflex "template" to date. It has a good design, is responsive, and has a Landing page. However, the original repository is very complex, with many files, and compiles very slowly. Therefore, this streamlined project was created. I copied the code from the [official repository](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-web), then reduced, reduced, and reduced it again with some adjustments. I hope this can serve as a simple starting template.


### vscode
If you find `*.py` in `templates/` folder not been highlighted, you can use command `ctrl+shift+p` and type `Change Language Mode` to change the language mode to `Python`.
